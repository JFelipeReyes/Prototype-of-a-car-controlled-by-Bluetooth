# PROTOTYPE OF A CAR CONTROLLES BY BLUETOOTH
In this repository you can find all the information related to the development of the final project of digital electronics II. The objective of this project was to develop a prototype of a car controlled remotely from a cell phone with AndroidOS using an application developed by the team.

# What's the use?

As its title says it is a prototype, it can be the basis for the development of a ROVER or exploration robot by adding a camera and thus remotely reconnoiter the terrain. If it is necessary to go to the field, its chassis must be restructured to ensure its resistance and depending on the terrain, the area where all the connections are located should be waterproofed.

# How to use?

Initially it must be ensured that the entire device is powered by a source of at least 5 volts to ensure proper operation of the device, as a step to follow would be to open the application developed by the working group and connect your mobile device to the Bluetooth module used in the assembly, it only remains to drive using the 3 speeds with which the device has to move forward, turns and reverse are limited to half the power, but thanks to the configuration perform turns on the same axis facilitating maneuvering in tight places.

# How to install it?

Download the APK of the application, go to the file manager to find the APK previously downloaded (if it is the first time you are going to install an APK from the file manager it will ask for permissions to do the installation, follow the steps that appear on the screen), at the end of the installation go to the main screen to start the application.
